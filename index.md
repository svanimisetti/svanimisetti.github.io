Hello,

Welcome to my website! I am an engineer in the automotive industry, with wide-raning
interests in systems engineering, automotive controls and and autonomous vehicles.

In my spare time, I explore and contribute to open source projects, primarily in the
Makerspace tools and software. I have interests in Linux, hobby CNC / motion control and astronomy.
